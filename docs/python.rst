The `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ guidelines are the
basis of the python style used in the code.

`Pylint <https://www.pylint.org/>`_ files are suplied (`utils/srccheck/pylint/`)
for code checking. In many cases, python unit tests are also implemented (see
`test/tools/dptools/` for examples).
